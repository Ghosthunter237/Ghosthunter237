- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ghosthunter237
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, art, music, and anything involving tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about making games in both Unity and Unreal. Hopefully I could make my own game engine some day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now.
- 📫 How to reach me marco.rivera2237@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm relearning how to do game development, though I've gone through most of Full Sail's game development course.
